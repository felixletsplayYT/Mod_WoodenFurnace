# Woodenfurnace
### A (fun) Minecraft mod
#### - Adds an furnace out of wood, which will burn everything

#### This will not be updated regulary, this was thought of just for fun and to prank everyone (like you say nowdays).
#### I will not spent time to get this to 1.13 because of the big changes needed in the already not so nice codebase.
#### If anyone want to get this idea to newer version, I would recommend to rewrite everything (maybe someday I will do).
